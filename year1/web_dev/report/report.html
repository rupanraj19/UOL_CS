                           <h6>I have inspired by 3 websites, which are EPL, ESPN, and CNA because of their unique designs and visuals.</h6>
                            <h5 class="mt-4 mb-2">EPL</h5>
                            <p>EPL (English premier league): The design of EPL's website is very clean and modern, with a color scheme that reflects the brand's identity. The use of vibrant colors like red and blue draws the eye to important information and creates a sense of energy and excitement. I like this website so much because of how they show the fixtures and points table. It is easier to understand.</p>

                            <h5 class="mt-4 mb-2">ESPN</h5>
                            <p>ESPN: ESPN is one of the most recognizable names in sports media, covering everything from American football to cricket. ESPN's website is bold and dynamic, with a color scheme that reflects the energy and excitement of sports. The use of bright shades of red, blue, and yellow creates a sense of urgency and passion, while the dynamic typography and eye-catching graphics draw the eye to important information and keep users engaged.</p>

                            <p>CNA (Channel NewsAsia): It is a Singapore-based news organization that covers a wide range of topics, including sports. Its coverage of football is particularly noteworthy, with in-depth analysis and interviews with players and coaches. I was inspired by their home page and I implemented my home page like theirs. It is my second favorite news website. Especially their color combination is good.</p>

                           <h6>I have leanred about Bootstrap, Advanced JS and CSS</h6>
                            <h5 class="mt-4 mb-2">Bootstrap</h5>
                            <p>Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that I recently learned about while building my football news website.
                                What I learned:
                                While learning Bootstrap, I discovered several key features and concepts that helped me improve my web development skills. A grid system that helped me create a responsive design for my website. By using the grid classes, I was able to divide my page into rows and columns and adjust the layout for different screen sizes. This allowed my website to look good on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. variety of pre-built components that saved me time and effort. I used the navigation bar, forms, buttons, and modal components to create a consistent and user-friendly design for my website. These components were already designed and tested, which saved me from having to create them from scratch. Customization, It is highly customizable, which allowed me to customize the design of my website to suit my needs. I was able to change the colors, typography, and layout of my website using Bootstrap's built-in classes and utilities. This made it easy to create a unique look and feel for my website.
                                overall, learning Bootstrap was a valuable experience for me. By using Bootstrap's grid system, pre-built components, and customization options, I was able to create a responsive and professional-looking website quickly and efficiently. I plan to continue using Bootstrap in future web development projects and would recommend it to others looking to improve their web development skills. This saved me a lot of time from typing out myself on CSS for every screen size.
                                </p>

                            <h5 class="mt-4 mb-2">JS</h5>
                            <p>what I learned from JavaScript and its Document Object Model (DOM) and how it was helpful to me in creating an interactive and dynamic website. Firstly, variables and data types allow me to store my article data in a list with the object. So it is for me to create one for loop and place all the data in a list. If not I would have to make 20 different functions for 20 articles. Secondly, I learned about the event listener and onclick function they have come is handy when we need to give life to a button where we click the button and the function takes action.</p>
                        
                            <h5 class="mt-4 mb-2">CSS</h5>
                            <p> I learned a lot of CSS animations with transitions and WebKit. It was fun but it was time-consuming as well. It took a lot of time. I learned about a box model that defines the layout of elements on a web page. I used this to create a grid layout for the news articles on my website. Overall, CSS allows me to create animations and transitions that enhance the user experience. I used this to create a fade-in effect for images on my homepage and a hover effect for buttons on my website.</p>

                            <h5 class="mt-4 mb-2">Nav bar</h5>
                            <p> Navigation: this will help users to navigate my website. This is crucial for the website. So I make my nav bar with clear and concise labels that accurately reflect the content of each page. For the active link indication, I use CSS to indicate the link is currently active, so the users can easily keep track of where they are on the site. At last, I use the same navbar and footer for all my pages so it looks very consistent in design.</p>

                            <h5 class="mt-4 mb-2">Responsiveness</h5>
                            <p>Responsiveness: I’m using bootstrap so it’s not a big deal in terms of bootstrap however I still need to add specific screen sizes to get good responsiveness as a whole. Test my website on different devices and screen sizes to ensure that it is responsive and looks good on all of them.</p>
                        
                            <h5 class="mt-4 mb-2">Usability for signup form</h5>
                            <p>Usability for signup form: I only use necessary input fields so it won’t look intimidating for users and it increases the chances to complete it. Next, I use clear labels to show what are the fields and I have an icon as well to help users understand the field. At last, the form has a button to submit the form.</p>

                            <p>I think I was successful with my fixture page and home page. I was able to build as I have planned earlier.
                                My home page is often the first impression that visitors have of your website, and it's important to create a design that is visually appealing and easy to navigate. By carefully planning and designing my home page, I have likely created a welcoming and engaging experience for your users.
                                Additionally, the fixture page is an important component of my website, especially for a football news website. It is where your users can find the latest information about upcoming matches, scores, and other important details. By effectively organizing and presenting this information, I have likely created a useful resource for my users and made it easy for them to stay up to date with the latest football news.
                                <br>
                                I have used two external js libraries. fancybox for the gallery box and AOS(animate on scroll) for my report slideshow. It was easier to work with libraries than hard coding by ourself.

I have an idea but I m not clear on how to implement it. I'm really stuggled to understand JS however i pushed myself to do the article with simple js. Therefore I need to learn more about JS and do more simple projects to hone mu skills. It was really fun doing web dev.
