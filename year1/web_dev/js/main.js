It also received opposition from UEFA, FIFA, and some national governments.[4] Much of the criticism was due to concerns about elitism and the lack of competitiveness within the ESL, as it would have consisted of high-ranking teams from selected European countries being permanent contestants in a semi-closed league format, similar to American professional-sport competition. There were also concerns that the ESL would potentially overshadow the continent's national leagues",

There is no club in the world more important than this shirt. If players understand that, good. If they don’t, while I’m here, we won’t pick them.”'Now, Scaloni has managed Argentina captain Lionel Messi, guiding him and the Argentina national team to World Cup victory.

John is right.The players we brought in last couple of transfer windows, Luis, Darwin and Cody, players in the first line. Sadio, Bobby and Mo were for a while best front line in football.
