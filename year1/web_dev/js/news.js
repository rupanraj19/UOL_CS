        body: "Jürgen Klopp hailed a ‘top performance’ from Liverpool after watching his side defeat Manchester United 7-0 at Anfield.Cody Gakpo, Darwin Nunez and Mohamed Salah each scored twice, with substitute Roberto Firmino adding a late seventh, as the Reds registered a club-record win over United.Six of their goals came in the second half as Klopp’s team ruthlessly picked their arch-rivals apart on a day when their push for Champions League qualification gathered pace in incredible fashion.   ",
        body2: "Freak result, top performance. A really top performance from the start, I thought the way we started the game was really special, the best for a long, long, long, long, long, long time. We were there, we were aggressive but we played football. We were calm in the right moments, super-lively, super-active in other moments [and] after 25 minutes it opened up a bit. United came a bit better into the game but the late goal before half-time was a sensational goal: what Robbo is doing there, cutting inside and is then really calm – what we were actually asking for, that in these moments we have to give ourselves time to get into the right position – and then Cody realised it early enough that Robbo wants to pass the ball there and a super finish. Second half starts, I don’t think the second half could start better with the two goals we forced there pretty much and from that moment on the boys were flying. Then it was really difficult to play against us and how I said, the performance is important, three points is even more important, and the result is just the result.",

        body2: "But according to the Telegraph, his new contract will not deter Chelsea, United, or Liverpool from chasing his signature, as they are set to go toe-to-toe in the battle to secure a new midfielder this summer.Brighton had received a lot of interest for the 21-year-old, who has started 21 of the 22 Premier League games he's been available for this season, returning a goal and an assist. Arsenal had made two bids to secure Caicedo, with their second offer of £70m being rejected by Brighton, failing to meet Brighton's £80m evaluation, with the Gunners instead opting to sign Jorginho from Chelsea.

        body: "Real Madrid were held to a 0-0 draw at Real Betis on Sunday to fall nine points behind leaders Barcelona at the top of the LaLiga table.Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois tipped an early shot from Real Betis forward Ayoze Perez over the bar before striker Karim Benzema had a goal for Real Madrid disallowed when his free kick touched Antonio Rudiger's arm on its way into the back of the net.",
        body2: "Claudio Bravo made a save on Benzema after halftime, and Courtois denied Borja Iglesias with a point-blank stop at the other end, before Real Madrid forward Rodrygo Goes missed perhaps the game's best chance, skying Federico Valverde's cross off target.Real Madrid will keep fighting until the end of the season -- the club's high standards demand nothing less -- but this draw saw Barcelona's lead at the top of LaLiga extended to nine points, and it's hard to envisage a scenario in which Barca's efficient, if unspectacular, team under manager Xavi squanders that advantage.Real Madrid's performance here was not poor. Real Betis are a good team and the Estadio Benito Villamarin is an intimidating arena, but Madrid were the better side, dominating possession, creating more chances and ending the game with an expected goals of 1.21 to Betis' 0.41. They were frustrated by some poor finishing, and a solid display by veteran Claudio Bravo in the Betis goal.",

However, Thomas Partey halved the deficit with a close-range finish on 62 minutes before two substitutes combined as Nelson crossed for Ben White to side-foot home a 70th-minute equaliser.",
        body2: "If last month's stoppage-time win at Aston Villa proves a pivotal moment in Arsenal's season, then Saturday's stunning comeback will be its equal at the very least. The atmosphere inside Emirates Stadium at full-time was nothing short of euphoric, securing the win so many anticipated before kick-off but in a manner nobody could have predicted: a last-gasp goal from a player on the periphery all season suddenly taking centre stage.Mikel Arteta has repeatedly spoken about Arsenal developing a winning mentality to last the pace in the title race by overcoming difficult experiences, and Bournemouth made this tougher than most expected, leading 2-0 with an hour played. Yet just as they recovered at Villa Park, the Gunners kept playing here -- finishing the afternoon with 31 shots, the highest number by any Premier League team this season -- and found a way to get over the line, Nelson's goal sparking an explosion of relief and joy as Arsenal's backroom staff flooded the pitch and fans stared at the pitch after the final whistle in sheer disbelief at what they had seen.On the face of it, beating 19th-placed Bournemouth at home is routine, but the way they achieved it will trigger a surge in self-belief that this could yet be their year. Saturday was the first time they have won a game in which they trailed by two or more goals at half-time since February 2012, spanning 65 matches.",
